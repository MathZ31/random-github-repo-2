### Set up:

- Clone the repo
- Add an `ApiKeys.ts` file to `src/lib/server/ApiKeys.ts` containing your tokens to use GitHub's API, like this :
```ts
export default class ApiKeys {
	static apiKeys: string[] = [
		'ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
		'ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
		'ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' // add as much tokens as you want
	];
}
```

Tokens can be generated by visiting the following link: https://github.com/settings/tokens. To create a new token, navigate to "Generate new token (classic)," choose an expiration period, and exclusively select the public_repo permission before generating the token.

You can use this database, which already contains more than a million GitHub repositories: [Download here](https://mega.nz/file/qawDQTgZ#85zEcD86AQ5MUKDPNJGT2kVQ4evmKymGXqaFRd3wgnU). If you'd like to use it, download it and move it to `database/database.db`.
